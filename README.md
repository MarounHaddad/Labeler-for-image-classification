# Labeler for binary image classification
 
This small application can be used for manual labeling of the images for machine learning tasks (Binary classes).   
This is done by splitting the images from a single source folder into two classes (a folder for each class).   
The prefix fields when filled with the "class prefix" will automatically update the labels and buttons (cat and dog are placeholder examples).  
The images will be color highlighted (red and green) for each class.  
Use the buttons to select the class of each image or the right and left arrows on your keyboard for fast labeling.  
In case of a mistake, you can readjust it by reselecting the correct class.   
A small score tracker introduces an element of gamification that tracks the number of correctly labeled images without a mistake...just to elevate a bit the boredom of the task :) .
